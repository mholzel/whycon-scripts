# Use this script to build the libraries
# on your local machine. You will need
# to call it from sudo like this: 
#
# $ sudo ./build
# 
# If you are planning on using the 
# Docker images, you should NEVER call 
# this script. In fact, it is preferable
# to use the Docker images since they 
# have the prebuilt distro, and never 
# require a build or setup (which is 
# prone to error).
# 
# To use the Docker images and run 
# whycon out of the box, just run the 
# script: ./run 
# which should be in this directory.
# That script will take care of 
# everything for you.
# 
# If you really do want to build the 
# code on your local machine, then you 
# should only need to run this script 
# once. If it was successful, then you 
# can run whycon by calling the 
# ./run_locally script which is also 
# in this directory.
