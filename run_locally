# This script will run whycon on your

# It is preferred that you run whycon 
# in Docker containers to ensure that 
# the build environment is properly
# configured.
# 
# Nonetheless, if you are dead-set on 
# running locally, then this script  
# will run whycon for each of the 
# connected cameras.

# Assign a base ip address and port and if one they are
# not passed. If this code runs on the host machine, then 
# you actually shouldn't need to specify the IP since 
# it will be grabbed inside of the c-code. However, 
# if you run inside of a Docker container, that will not
# work. Essentially, it will always report the localhost 
# address. So it needs to be passed as an argument so that 
# the gui displays the correct value.
